If you're looking for a Java library to convert Word documents to PDF without using iText or Apache POI, and ensuring it's suitable for commercial use and free from vulnerabilities, you can consider using **Aspose.Words for Java**. Aspose.Words is a robust commercial library that provides comprehensive support for working with Microsoft Word documents, including conversion to PDF. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Using Aspose.Words for Java

1. **Add Aspose.Words Dependency**:
   You need to add the Aspose.Words for Java dependency to your project. Aspose.Words is a commercial library, so you'll need to obtain a license if you plan to use it in a commercial setting.

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.aspose</groupId>
       <artifactId>aspose-words</artifactId>
       <version>22.4</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
   </dependency>
   ```

   You also need to include the Aspose.Words repository in your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <repositories>
       <repository>
           <id>AsposeJavaAPI</id>
           <name>Aspose Java API</name>
           <url>http://repository.aspose.com/repo/</url>
       </repository>
   </repositories>
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are using Gradle, add the dependency in your `build.gradle`:

   ```gradle
   dependencies {
       implementation 'com.aspose:aspose-words:22.4' // Replace with the latest version
   }
   ```

2. **Set Up License** (if applicable):
   If you're using Aspose.Words in a commercial environment, you need to set up a license to remove evaluation limitations. You can obtain a license from the Aspose website and set it up in your code. Here's an example of how you would set the license:

   ```java
   import com.aspose.words.License;

   public class LicenseExample {

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Set path to the license file
           String licenseFile = "path_to_your_license_file.xml";

           // Initialize license
           try {
               License license = new License();
               license.setLicense(licenseFile);
               System.out.println("License set successfully.");
           } catch (Exception e) {
               e.printStackTrace();
               System.err.println("Failed to set license: " + e.getMessage());
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Java Code**:
   Write Java code to convert a Word document to PDF using Aspose.Words:

   ```java
   import com.aspose.words.Document;
   import com.aspose.words.SaveFormat;

   import java.io.FileInputStream;
   import java.io.FileOutputStream;

   public class DocToPdfConverter {

       public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
           convertDocToPdf("input.docx", "output.pdf");
       }

       public static void convertDocToPdf(String docFilePath, String pdfFilePath) throws Exception {
           // Load the document
           FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(docFilePath);
           Document doc = new Document(fis);

           // Save as PDF
           FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(pdfFilePath);
           doc.save(fos, SaveFormat.PDF);

           // Close streams
           fos.close();
           fis.close();

           System.out.println("DOCX to PDF conversion successful.");
       }
   }
   ```
